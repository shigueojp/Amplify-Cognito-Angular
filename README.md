# Amplify Cross Account Using CodePipeline
 
This project was generated with:
 - [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.
 - [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli) version 4.20.0.

The frontend is using Angular with amplify angular UI and themes. 

The backend is using Amplify with the following services:
- S3 as Storage.
- Cognito with custom confirmation link to register and confirm a new user (Lambda Trigger + S3VerificationBucket).
- S3 for hosting Angular Application.
  
Furthermore, it`s using cross account simulating two AWS accounts: developer and production.
- Developer AWS Account is related to dev/test branches.
- Production AWS Account is related to master branch.

## Setup AWS Profile

>Create **two** IAM Users:
>>One simulating Developer/Test AWS Account.
>>
>>Another simulating Production AWS Account.

**Creating Developer/Test AWS Account**
1. In your terminal, run `amplify configure`.
2. Sign in to your **dev/test** AWS account, go to terminal and `Press Enter` and follow the commands:
   1. Specify the AWS region.
   2. Specify the username of IAM user.
3. Click in the link and register a new IAM user.
4. Create a user with **AdministratorAccess** to your account to provision AWS resources for you like AppSync, Cognito etc.
5. Once the user is created, Amplify CLI requests you to provide the **accessKeyId** and the **secretAccessKey** to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user.
6. Specify AWS Profile name to **amplify-for-dev-test**.

## Diagram - Amplify Environment
![Amplify Environment](img/AmplifyEnvironment.png)

In the next steps, we are going to create all the amplify resources from the diagram above for each environment.

> :warning: Not recommended to name any service with sufix(dev, test, prod). Amplify already create sufix tags for each service added.

### Creating Amplify Environment - Development

1. Run `npm install` to install all the packages needed.
2. Run `git checkout -b dev` to create the dev branch.
3. Run `amplify init` and follow the instructions according to your environment.
    ![AmplifyInit](img/amplifyInit.png)
4. Amplify requests for an AWS Profile. (Answer Y, choose the dev/test AWS profile - **amplify-for-dev-test**).
    ![Amplify00](img/amplify00.png)
4. Run `amplify add auth` to add Cognito. In order to use custom lambda trigger with cognito, follow the steps below:
    ![Amplify02](img/amplify02.png)
5. Run `amplify add storage` to add s3 storage.
![Amplify03](img/amplify03.png)
    - Choose `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`.
    - Provide a friendly name for your resource.
    - Provide a bucket name for your resource.
    - Grant permissions for your bucket.
    - Define if you want yo use lamda trigger for S3.

aws ssm put-parameter --name "secret-key-amplify-dev-test" --type "SecureString" --value "YourSecretKey"

```
    - Replace **YourAccessKey** for your Access Key.
    - Replace **YourSecretKey** for your Secret Key.
    - Do not forget to use `SecureString` to leverage best security practices.

2. Edit buildspec-dev.yml | env > parameter-store with your keys created.
```
env:
  parameter-store:
    ACCESS_KEY: "access-key-amplify-dev-test"
    SECRET_KEY: "secret-key-amplify-dev-test"
    ENV_AMPLIFY: "amplifyEnvDev"
```

3. Edit buildspec-test.yml | env > parameter-store with your keys created.
```
env:
  parameter-store:
    ACCESS_KEY: "access-key-amplify-dev-test"
    SECRET_KEY: "secret-key-amplify-dev-test"
    ENV_AMPLIFY: "amplifyEnvTest"
```
If you change any of the **buildspec-files**, commit and push. 

**For production environment:**

1. Sign in with **Developer/Test** AWS Account.
2. Store **Production AWS Account ID**  using SSM Parameter Store via AWS CLI OR AWS Console.
    1. To get your AWS Production Account ID via AWS CLI:

        }
    ]
}
```

2. Open your cloudfront DNS at your browser!

## Issues

**Custom Message - ENV Variables**

- If you want to change the Environment Variables from lambda custom message authentication:
    - Change directly from console.
    ![Amplify40](img/amplify40.png)

**Returning to amplify configuration from the cloud**

For some reason, you changed amplify configuration and want to return to the same configuration in the cloud.
- To return back to the same amplify configuration as in the cloud.
    - Run `amplify pull`, it`ll return to the original state.
